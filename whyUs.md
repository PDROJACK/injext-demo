Data is important for almost everyone on this planet. But data alone isn't valuable, finding patterns and insights from data to solve problems is the need of the hour and I find it really interesting. I think that Palantir is the desired place for me to work as it provides a diverse range of opportunities and problems to solve in many areas like defence, finance, technology etc. These opportunities will not help me to test my skills but will also improve them.
