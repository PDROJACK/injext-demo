During my internship, I had to create a backend API for a mobile application. But the tricky part for me was to make the API a microservice So that it will be easier to connect it with other services. I created an event-driven microservice architecture using message-queue which helped me to connect the backend service with a machine learning service and a streaming service. I am proud of it because it made me think out of my comfort zone and I learned new techniques and technologies.
